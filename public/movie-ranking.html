<h1>Zbayje's Ranks</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Series</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>
this is by far the best series to ever watch<br/>
from season 1 till season 6<br/>
</p>
<h3>GoT</h3>
<p>
the second best series after BB <br/>
if the last season was better it could be the top 1<br/>
</p>
<h3>Vikings</h3>
<p>
Ragnar, one of the best roles in history of series<br/>
tho its a true story, yet you'll be sad at the end<br/>
